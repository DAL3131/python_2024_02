news = """The American retaliation is also drawing growing condemnation from others in the region, including from the Iraqi and Syrian governments.

"No warning was given during the strike or the night of the strike," Farhad Alaaldin, a senior adviser to Iraq's prime minister, told the BBC's Newshour programme on Sunday about Friday's strikes.

He added that the "issue of warning or no warning makes no difference to the fact of the matter that Iraq is a sovereign state".

A crowd gathered in Baghdad on Sunday to mourn the deaths of 17 pro-Tehran militia members in the US air strikes.

The group chanted "America is the greatest devil" and held aloft pictures of the victims as they followed a fleet of ambulances carrying their bodies.

Oman's foreign minister also spoke on Sunday to express his "grave concerns over the continuous escalation in the region", in a statement shared with the Oman News Agency.

Badr Albusaidi questioned the effectiveness of US retaliatory attacks, noting that "such actions compromise the region's safety, stability, and efforts to tackle challenges like violence and extremism"."""
